# SimCLR-vs-FineTuning-STL10
 
This repository contains the implementation of a comparative study between Self-Supervised Learning (SimCLR), Transfer Learning (Fine-Tuning), and Supervised Learning (Baseline) using ResNet-50 on the STL-10 dataset.

This project was developed for the CMP722 - Advanced Computer Vision course.
